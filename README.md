## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS ](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### What I learned

- **TailwindCSS for Responsive Design:** In this project, I deepened my understading of TailwindCSS which allowed me to quickly build responsive layouts without writing custom CSS
- **Framer Motion for Animations:** I gained experience with adding animations to React components using Framer Motion.
